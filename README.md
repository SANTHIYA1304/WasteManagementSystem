Environmental Waste Collection Route Planning & Pickup Assignment System is a console-based Java application built using JDBC that helps municipal waste management supervisors organize and control waste collection activities. 
The system manages two types of data: master data (service zones and collection vehicles) and transactional data (pickup schedules and completion records). 
Supervisors can register zones and vehicles, view their details, schedule pickups based on routing constraints and vehicle suitability, track expected versus actual waste volumes, and safely remove records only when no active pickups exist.
The application follows a layered architecture with beans for data models, DAO classes for database operations, a service layer for validations and business logic, and a main controller for execution, ensuring structured design, data integrity, and efficient scheduling of waste collection operations.
